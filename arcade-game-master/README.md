# Fake Frogger Arcade Game

## Overview
This is a simple arcade style game that is supposed to mimick the classic arcade game "Frogger". This game allows the player to use their directional keys on their keyboard to maneuver a player around the board. The objective of the game is to guide the character to the blue area without getting hit by the creatures that are crossing the grey area. Get to the blue without getting hit, and your score goes up! Get hit and go back to 0!

## How to use
### To play the game: 
* Download the zip file from Github. 
* Open zip file. 
* Open index.html in any browser. 

### Code Structure
* app.js has all the behaviour of the characters. 
* engine.js has all of the game functionality. 
* resources.js image processing helper file. 

## Known issues
* Scoreboard appears on bottom left of canvas and is not appealing. 
* Enemy movement is very predictable. 
* Enemies speeds do not differ by much. 
* Enemies come on to canvas seemingly at the same time. 

## Contributing
Please do! Although I recommend not making any changes to engine.js or resources.js.
